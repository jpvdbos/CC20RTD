Welcome to the documentation pages of the Contact centre 2.0 platform and service. 

Conversations in 4 channels
---------------------------
For customers and agents we support four channels. Voice, chat, video and e-mail.
Conversations in these channels can be combined. And you may add self-service features as you see fit.

It’s a platform!
----------------
ING teams design and build the solution. We operate as a platform and support local teams in all participating countries.  In addition we co-create with other ING tribes to extend our platform to mobile and internet banking.

You are in control
------------------
Senior users, team leaders and customer journey experts are in control. By making the features of our platform available for them to configure and operate, they have direct influence on the customer journey.
