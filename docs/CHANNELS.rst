Channels in CC2.0
=================

The Contact center 2.0 platform (CC20) supports 4 channels:

#. Voice
#. Chat
#. Video
#. E-mail and actions. 

Your customers use these channels to connect to your members, the agents in the contact centers. For voice they use their own phone of course. For chat and video we deliver and maintain apps that are part of your ING website and Internet banking. Soon, we'll also start supporting the Mobile banking app. 
For e-mail your customers use their own e-mail client. Actions are different: These are pieces of work that the contact center take care of. And that you can route together with the conversations. 

Customer journey experts craft customer experiences in these channels. For voice this may include self service and intelligent routing of inbound calls. In chat we support integration with chat bots. And video can be integrated with self service pages where appointments are made. 

Developers and customer journey experts create routing patterns for all 4 channels. In these patterns you set priorities and create work streams that fit the way of work of the contact centers. These are also reflected on the CC20 dashboards. And become part of the events recorded in the ING Datalake and the events stored in TeleOpti for planning. 

Agents benefit from the Omnichannel toolbar that allows them to handle their conversations in one app. Of course they too can use dashboards and planning. As can supervisors and team leaders.
